# kOS---Scripts

To install just add all files in the "kOS---Scripts"-folder to a "$your_KSP_install_folder/Ships/Script"-folder.

Running "/boot/default.ks" in game loads all libraries in "/libraries" to your kOS core 
and lets you run one of the scripts in "/launch".

The "runF.ks" script allows to run any library function from the **kOS** console, a feature which is still missing from kOS.
